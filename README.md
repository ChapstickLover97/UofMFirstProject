## UofMFirstProject

This is my first (and definitely not last) attempt at applying more accessability to Horiseon's Social Media Page, as well as simplifying some parts of the code and making other tweaks.  This is definitely not a good submission - Xcode spent 2 hours downloading because Verizon's decided to throttle our Internet basically since the day we started class, so I'm literally doing the best I can while I can (seriously Verizon it should not take 2 hours to download a 7gb app).  As far as the lack of commits goes, that's just because I hate Git and want to use it as little as humanly possible (I also understand this will not work in the longterm, but allow me to be esoteric until I absolutely can't).
